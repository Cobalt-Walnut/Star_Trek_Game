Here, all of the sounds used in the game are stored. You can change them if you want, but keep in mind that
the names of the sounds and the format (.wav) must stay the same. If you want to change the format, edit
the code near the top of the main function ( Lines 856 - 861). I got the sounds at (https://freesound.org).
It's a great website to get sounds.
